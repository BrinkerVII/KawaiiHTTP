# KawaiiHTTP

KawaiiHTTP is a small HTTP server written in C#. I wrote it back in 2015 because I needed a semi-portable http server for a project that wasn't as clunky as ASP.NET MVC.

Some feature creep did get in, in the form of a semi-proxy kind of deal, it can be turned off by changing a boolean in SettingsObject.js

I decided to upload all of its source code to GitHub, maybe someone finds it useful for their own projects. There are some bugs in the source code, those are yours to find :) 

Good luck and don't get bit by the dragons üêâ
